## Initial Linting Errors

### Error: `Delete '‚êç' prettier/prettier`

- **Description**: This error was caused by Windows-style carriage return (`\r`) characters in the code. ESLint, with Prettier, flagged these as formatting inconsistencies because it expected Unix-style line endings (`\n`).
- **Resolution**: Updated the Prettier configuration to enforce Unix-style line endings by adding `"endOfLine": "lf"` in `.prettierrc`. This was followed by running the command:

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```
